This section includes figures on retail sales, business activity, indices for the construction and manufacturing industries and international trade."
,Business,,"We focus on businesses that are registered for VAT or PAYE, which means some very small businesses are not covered. We publish the number of businesses in the UK, with regional breakdowns. Business size is based on employment and turnover. Business activity specifies the type of industry."
,,"Activity, size and location",Information provides a count of enterprises and local units produced from a snapshot of the Inter Departmental Business Register.

The CPI estimates changes to the total cost of this basket.

"
,,Population projections,"National population projections are available by age and sex for the UK and its constituent countries. These population projections are based on mid-year population estimates and a set of underlying assumptions regarding future fertility, mortality and migration. They provide an indication of the impact that changes in demographic patterns might have on the size and age structure of the population in the future. These projections are widely used for resource allocation and planning. "
,Well-being,,"Measuring national well-being is about looking beyond what we produce, to areas such as health, relationships, education and skills, what we do, where we live, our finances and the environment.
